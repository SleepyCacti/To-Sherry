**The Fish Spa...**  I still remember how ticklish this was. I was struggling to keep my feet in the water 😥, but I eventually "locked in" at the end!

## A Lil Message to my Gundu Bubba

I want to tell you that I am really grateful that you're with me and that I can share all these moments with you. I know that we have had our ups and downs and this year, it hasn't been all that rosy for us. I feel really sorry for the times that I have hurt you and I want to thank you for being patient with me and for loving me despite my flaws. I am really lucky to have you in my life and I wouldn't have it any other way with anyone else. Thank you for being my Gundu Bubba. I love you and Happy Valentine's Day <3
